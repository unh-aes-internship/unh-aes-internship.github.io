<summary><b>What are the best sources to look for an internship?</b></summary>
<p>Students are encouraged to start their search on Handshake as most of the employers who posted their jobs are looking for UNH students. Students can also apply for jobs through the website of the company/organization they are interested in, or through job websites such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.indeed.com">Indeed</a> and <a href="https://hired.com/">Hired</a>. Do attend internship fair on both Manchester and Durham campus, and also speak with family, friends, and faculty.

<summary><b>Do I still need to take the course if I am currently working?</b></summary>
<p>Yes, you do. Even if you are currently working or have worked in the past, you will still need to take the Internship Experience course as a degree requirement. However, you don't need to search for another internship position if you are currently working in the field. You may use the applied research option. You will need to
<ul>
<li> Propose project ideas, e.g., research projects. The scope of the project may or may not directly relate to the current job assignment, depending on your time commitment, availability of your supervisor or company policy. </li>

</li> Meet with your potential workplace supervisor to discuss project’s goal and objectives, and ask for their approval to supervise your project; </li>

<li> Meet with the internship faculty advisor to finalize project’s scope, content, development plan, and expected outcomes; You also need to submit a research project proposal.</li>

<li>   Complete the minimum number of work hours on the project based on the number of credits you register for the course. Seek feedback from your supervisor during the project.</li>
</ul>

The academic work hours for the applied research project may not involve one’s regular work hours on site or be compensated unless the company or site supervisor agrees to do so.  If you have further questions, please contact the course instructor.

<details>
<summary><b>What do I need to request CPT Authorization with my internship?</b></summary>
<p>
To request CPT Authorization you will need the following items:
    <ul>
    <li>internship job description or job posting</li>
    <li>internship offer letter</li>
    <li>proof of your course registration (a screen shot of your registration in the Internship course will suffice as long as your name or UNH student ID number is visible)</li>
    </ul>
<b>Important Notes:</b>
    <ol>
    <li>The internship offer letter must include your specific dates of employment.  For example, if you are working for the duration of the Fall 2019 semester, the dates you are eligible to work between are 8/26/2019 and 12/20/2019.</li>
    <li>CPT authorization coincides with the semester dates.  Employment cannot begin until the first day of the semester (usually around January 20th), therefore, there will be a 4 week period of time (approximately) that you cannot work in between semesters.</li>
    <li>You should discuss CPT with Rousseau, Christine <Christine.Rousseau@unh.edu></li>
    </ol>
For the semester if it becomes an option.  Federal regulations limit the amount of CPT a student can use during their degree program in order to still be eligible for post-completion OPT.
