The academic work hours for the applied research project may not involve one’s regular work hours on site or be compensated unless the company or site supervisor agrees to do so. You need to submit a research project proposal. The proposal is limited to no more than 2 pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes.
