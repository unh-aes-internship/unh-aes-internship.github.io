For example, if you are enrolled in 3 credit hours of Internship Experience class then you have to complete 120 hours of internship. You don't have to submit more weekly logs after you reach the total hours required based on your registered credits. Also, you don't need to submit any logs for the weeks you have not worked.</p></details> <details> <summary><b>Can I start my internship position before the Internship Experience course starts?</b></summary><p>Yes. You may start your internship before the course starts, but you can count only up to 20% of the hours toward the total internship hours required, providing that you will complete the remaining hours during the same semester.</p></details> <details> <summary><b>What do I need to request CPT Authorization with my internship?</b></summary><p> To request CPT Authorization you will need the following items:<ul><li>internship job description or job posting<li>internship offer letter<li>proof of your course registration (a screen shot of your registration in the Internship course will suffice as long as your name or UNH student ID number is visible)</ul><b>Important Notes:</b><ol><li>The internship offer letter must include your specific dates of employment.

Employment cannot begin until the first day of the semester (usually around January 20th), therefore, there will be a 4 week period of time (approximately) that you cannot work in between semesters.<li>You should discuss CPT with Rousseau, Christine &lt;Christine.Rousseau@unh.edu&gt;</ol>For the semester if it becomes an option. Federal regulations limit the amount of CPT a student can use during their degree program in order to still be eligible for post-completion OPT.</p></details> <details> <summary><b>What are the steps to request CPT Authorization?</b></summary><p> To request CPT Authorization, please follow these steps:<ul><li>Meet with the Internship Advisor Professor Karen Jin &lt;karen.jin@unh.edu&gt; prior to submitting the OISS eForm.<li>Login to <a href="https://www.unh.edu/global/eoiss-online-services">eOISS</a><li>Under F-1 Practical Training, choose “CPT Authorization Form”.<li>Complete the form and upload a letter from your employer describing your job title, responsibilities, place of employment, start/end dates and the number of hours you will work per week.<li>Upload proof of registration for the internship class (a screen print of your registration will suffice).
