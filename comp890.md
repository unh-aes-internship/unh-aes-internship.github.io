**Course Information**<br>
Name:			COMP 890 Internship Experience<br>

**Course Description**<br>
The internship experience enhances the student's academic achievements with real-world, professional IT projects through placement at business, industry, and other sponsoring organizations. The student is expected to apply knowledge and skills acquired through other coursework in the major to address and solve new, authentic problems identified by the internship employer. Under the direction of a faculty advisor and workplace supervisor, the student is expected to contribute to the information technology products, processes, or services of the organization. May be repeated for a maximum of 6 credits. Permission required. Cr/F.
Permission required.


**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**Placement**<br>

Students need to complete the minimal number of hours for onsite work OR the completion of an applied research project based on the list below

* 120 work hours for 3 credits
* 80 hours for 2 credits
* 40 hours for 1 credit


Students have two placement options:

*Internship Work Option*<br>
Students will secure an internship experience to complete the required minimum hours of onsite work hours. You should:
-   Contact faculty advisor to review placement options and procedures.
-   Interview with internship sponsors to locate an appropriate experience.
-   After an internship offer is made and accepted, meet with the workplace supervisor to:
    -   Determine your duties and responsibilities at the internship site.
    -   Outline expectations you have from the internship experience.

*Applied Research Option*<br />

If you are employed in the field, instead of internship work hours you are required to conduct applied research in IT. The project should meet specific IT needs identified by the organization where you work or another sponsoring organization.  This requires that you:

*   Propose project ideas, e.g., research projects. The scope of the project may or may not directly relate to the current job assignment, depending on your time commitment, availability of your supervisor or company policy.
*   Meet with your potential workplace supervisor to discuss project’s goal and objectives, and ask for their approval to supervise your project;
*   Meet with the internship faculty advisor to finalize project’s scope, content, development plan, and expected outcomes;
*   Complete the minimum number of work hours on the project based on the number of credits you register for the course. Seek feedback from your supervisor during the project.

The academic work hours for the applied research project may not involve one’s regular work hours on site or be compensated unless the company or site supervisor agrees to do so.

You need to submit a research project proposal. The proposal is limited to no more than 2 pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes.

*Approval Process for Both Options*<br>
Students are required to:
-	Create and submit a new Experience in [Handshake website.](https://app.joinhandshake.com/experiences/new)
-	Login into Handshake (navigate to Career Center, Experiences, Request New Experience)
-	Complete the information required under your academic program and hit submit. You will need to know the contact information for your internship site and site supervisor. You can often get this information off of your offer letter.
-	Requests to approve this internship will go to your internship site supervisor and your faculty. Once both of these people approve your experience you are all set until final evaluations are needed

Best Practices are:
-	Monitor the approval process on Handshake until it is fully approved. You can learn exactly where the process is by logging into Handshake. If someone makes a request for you to change something, you will want to respond promptly.
-	Let your internship supervisors know they will be getting a request for approval from the Handshake platform. All the supervisor has to do is review and click yes or no for approval. The UNHM Career and Professional Success (CaPS) will connect the employer later on for evaluation purposes.

**Required Paperwork and Submissions.**<br>
A record of the semester-long internship experience will be assembled as a portfolio of paperwork and other required documents.  The portfolio should contain the following components.

*Internship Documents*<br>
-    Internship position post and offer letter OR statement of project goal and objectives.
-    Sponsoring Organization:
    -    Discussion of the organization and specific IT support system. Indicate your understanding of the company and professional field you are working in. Include any relevant literature about the organization.
    -    Memos or documents you developed as part of your work at OR for the organization. The Internship Documents, once completed, should be submitted to the Internship and Career Planning office.
-    Evaluation form from the workplace supervisor, which will be solicited at the end of the internship.

*Internship Weekly Work Log:*<br>
The work log contains weekly entries. Each entry is dated and represents a commentary on the work you are doing, what you have learned, and the challenges faced.  You also need to log the hours have worked for the week and the total accumulative hours for the internship (till the current week). The weekly log entry is submitted through MyCourses and must be submitted every week.

*Final Report:*<br>
The final report explains the nature and outcomes of the work accomplished.
See Appendix B for the detailed report requirements.

If you choose the applied research option, you need to also submit a research project proposal prior to the beginning of your project. The proposal is limited to no more than two pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes.
The Final Report should be submitted through MyCourses.

*Class Meetings and Progress Presentation:*

**Class Meetings**
-    Participation in the scheduled class meetings is required. We will have 3 to 5 class meetings during each semester.
-    You are required to participate in all scheduled meetings and present your work progress during the meetings.

**GRADING AND EVALUATION OF STUDENT WORK**

To earn the CR grade in the course, you will need to complete
-    all required internship documents/paperwork.
-    the total work hour requirements (based on your registered credits)
-    weekly logs to log the required number of work hours.
-    a final report.
-    all required in-class presentations and out of class discussions.

Students must fulfill all the above requirements to receive a final grade.

The grading also takes into consideration the evaluation by workplace supervisor.  Missing evaluation will result in deduction to your final grade.  On the other hand, very positive evaluation can earn you up to extra bonus points to your final grade.

**COURSE POLICIES REGARDING STUDENT BEHAVIOR**

**Attendance**<br>
Students are responsible for attending scheduled meetings and expected to abide by the University Policy on Attendance (as stated in the *UNH Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities*).

Students who cannot attend a scheduled meeting have the responsibility to email the instructor about the circumstances and request to be excused for the meeting. Otherwise, a zero grade will be given for the class meeting.

**Late submissions of portfolio artifacts**<br>
Policy for late submissions is very strict and applies only in exceptional cases of student illness, accident, or emergencies that are properly documented. A late submission may be granted only if the student:
-	Emails prior to the deadline and
-	Explains and provides evidence for the circumstances that have prevented the student from meeting class requirement.
Failing to comply with these rules may result in no credit for the course.

**STATEMENT ON ACADEMIC HONESTY**<br>
An internship is a learning opportunity, and as such, it is subject to the same academic honesty policy as any other coursework at UNH. Any attempts to defraud the internship site of hours, deception concerning hours spend at the internship, or fabrication of project proposal, report, or poster are subject to the same academic misconduct penalties as any in-class coursework.
See [Academic Honesty](http://www.unh.edu/vpsas/handbook/academic-honesty) for more information.
