**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**Placement**<br>
Students have two placement options:

*Internship Work Option*<br>
Students will secure an internship experience for commitment of minimum 45 hours/credit. This requires that you:
-	Meet with faculty advisor to review placement options and procedures.

-	After an internship offer is made and accepted, meet with the workplace supervisor to:
    -	Determine your duties and responsibilities at the internship site.
    -	Outline expectations you have from the internship experience.

*Applied Research Option*<br>
If you are currently employed in the field, instead of internship work hours you are required to conduct applied research in IT. The project should meet specific IT needs identified by the organization where you work or another sponsoring organization.  This requires that you:
-	Meet with workplace supervisor to discuss project’s goal and objectives.
-	Meet with faculty advisor to finalize project’s scope, content, development plan, and expected outcomes.

*Requirements for Both Options*<br>
For both options students are required to:
-	Fill out a UNH Manchester Internship Agreement.
-	After an internship offer has been made and accepted OR sponsored project agreed upon, students meet with their workplace supervisor to fill out:
    -	Intern Duties and Responsibilities section
    -	Intern Expectations from Placement section of the Internship Agreement and
    -	Get the site supervisor’s signature.
-	Contact with faculty advisor to describe the internship academic component and sign/date the form. Give the original form with signatures to the Internship Coordinator. Keep a copy for your records.

**Required Paperwork and Submissions.**<br>
A record of your semester long internship experience will be assembled as a portfolio of paperwork and other required documents.  The portfolio should contain the following components.

    -	Discussion of the organization and specific IT support system. Indicate your understanding of the company and professional field you are working in. Include any relevant literature about the organization.

-	Evaluation form from the workplace supervisor, which will be solicited at the end of internship.

*Part II: Internship Weekly Work Log:*<br>
The work log contains weekly entries. Each entry is dated and represents a commentary on the work you are doing, what you learn, and challenges you experience. You need to also log the hours you have worked for the week and the total accumulative hours for the internship (till current week).  
-	See Appendix A for the detailed weekly work log format requirements in resources tab.

The proposal is limited to no more than 4 pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes.
