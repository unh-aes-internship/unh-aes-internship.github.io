<br>**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**<br>

**Internship Work Hours & Placement**<br>

Students need to complete the minimal number of onsite work hours based on the list below, OR the completion of an applied research project with the same hours.

- 150 work hours for 4 credits.
- 120 work hours for 3 credits.
- 80 hours for 2 credits.
- 40 hours for 1 credit.

Students have two placement options:

*Internship Work Option*<br>
Students will secure an internship experience to complete the required minimum hours of onsite work hours. You should:
-	Contact faculty advisor to review placement options and procedures.
-	Interview with internship sponsors to locate an appropriate experience.
-	After an internship offer is made and accepted, meet with the workplace supervisor to:
    -	Determine your duties and responsibilities at the internship site.
    -	Outline expectations you have from the internship experience.

*Applied Research Option*<br>
If you are employed in the field, instead of internship work hours you are required to conduct applied research in IT. The project should meet specific IT needs identified by the organization where you work or another sponsoring organization.  This requires that you:
-	Meet with workplace supervisor to discuss project’s goal and objectives.
-	Meet with faculty advisor to finalize project’s scope, content, development plan, and expected outcomes.
-	Complete minimum number of work hours on your project based on the number of credits you register for the course.<br>
You need to submit a research project proposal. The proposal is limited to no more than 2 pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes.

*Approval Process for Both Options*<br>
Students are required to:
-	Create and submit a new Experience in [Handshake website.](https://app.joinhandshake.com/experiences/new)
-	Login into Handshake (navigate to Career Center, Experiences, Request New Experience)
-	Complete the information required under your academic program and hit submit. You will need to know the contact information for your internship site and site supervisor. You can often get this information off of your offer letter.
-	Requests to approve this internship will go to your internship site supervisor and your faculty. Once both of these people approve your experience you are all set until final evaluations are needed

Best Practices are:
-	Monitor the approval process on Handshake until it is fully approved. You can learn exactly where the process is by logging into Handshake. If someone makes a request for you to change something, you will want to respond promptly.
-	Let your internship supervisors know they will be getting a request for approval from the Handshake platform. All the supervisor has to do is review and click yes or no for approval. The UNHM Career and Professional Success (CaPS) will connect the employer later on for evaluation purposes.

**Required Paperwork and Submissions**  
A record of your semester long internship experience will be assembled as a portfolio of paperwork and other required documents.  The portfolio should contain the following components.

*Part I: Internship Weekly Work Log:* contains weekly entries. Each entry is dated and represents a commentary on the work you are doing, what you learn, and challenges you experience. You need to also log the hours you have worked for the week and the total accumulative hours for the internship (till current week).  See Appendix A for weekly log format.

*Part II: Final Report:* explains the nature and outcomes of the work you have accomplished.
-	See Appendix B for report requirement.
-	If you choose the applied research option, you need to also submit a research project proposal prior to the beginning of your project. The proposal is limited to no more than 2 pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes. The proposal is due by the Friday of the second week in the semester.

*Part III: Progress Presentation Slides*
-	During the semester, each student is required to present to the class their current status and progress of internship in two of the class meetings.  
-	Each presentation is limited to 10-15 minutes and should include 5-8 slides.  See Appendix C for presentation guidelines.
