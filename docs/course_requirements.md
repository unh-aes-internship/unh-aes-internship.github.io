# Course Requirements
## Internship Work Hours & Placement

Students need to complete the minimal number of hours for onsite work OR the completion of an applied research project based on the list below

* 40 hours for 1 credit (upto 3 credits).
* 150 work hours for 4 credits.


## Students have two placement options:

<details>
<summary><b>Internship Work Option</b></summary>

<br>
Students will secure an internship experience to complete the required minimum hours of onsite work hours. You should:
<ul>
<li>Contact faculty advisor to review placement options and procedures.</li>
<li>Interview with internship sponsors to locate an appropriate experience.</li>
<li>After an internship offer is made and accepted, meet with the workplace supervisor to:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Determine your duties and responsibilities at the internship site.</li>
  <li>Outline expectations you have from the internship experience.</li></ul>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Applied Research Option</b></summary>

<br>
If you are employed in the field, instead of internship work hours you are required to conduct applied research in IT. The project should meet specific IT needs identified by the organization where you work or another sponsoring organization. This requires that you:
<ul>
<li>Propose project ideas, e.g., research projects. The scope of the project may or may not directly relate to the current job assignment, depending on your time commitment, availability of your supervisor or company policy.</li>
<li>Meet with your potential workplace supervisor to discuss project’s goal and objectives, and ask for their approval to supervise your project;</li>
<li>Meet with the internship faculty advisor to finalize project’s scope, content, development plan, and expected outcomes;</li>
<li>Complete the minimum number of work hours on the project based on the number of credits you register for the course. Seek feedback from your supervisor during the project.</li>
</ul>
The academic work hours for the applied research project may not involve one’s regular work hours on site or be compensated unless the company or site supervisor agrees to do so.

You need to submit a research project proposal. The proposal is limited to no more than 2 pages, and it should identify the content and scope of the project, a development plan with intermediate milestones, and expected outcomes.

## Approval Process for Both Options

Students are required to:

* Create and submit a new Experience in <a href = "https://app.joinhandshake.com/login" target="blank">Handshake website.</a>
* Login into Handshake (navigate to Career Center, Experiences, Request New Experience)
* Complete the information required under your academic program and hit submit. You will need to know the contact information for your internship site and site supervisor. You can often get this information off of your offer letter.
* Requests to approve this internship will go to your internship site supervisor and your faculty. Once both of these people approve your experience you are all set until final evaluations are needed

Best Practices are:

* Monitor the approval process on Handshake until it is fully approved. You can learn exactly where the process is by logging into Handshake. If someone makes a request for you to change something, you will want to respond promptly.
* Let your internship supervisors know they will be getting a request for approval from the Handshake platform. All the supervisor has to do is review and click yes or no for approval. The UNHM Career and Professional Success (CaPS) will connect the employer later on for evaluation purposes.
