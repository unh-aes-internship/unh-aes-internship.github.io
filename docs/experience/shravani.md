## Shravani
* Worked as a Web Application Developer intern at the University of New Hampshire, Manchester. It was during her first semester at UNH that she was introduced to web application development as part of her coursework where she developed a profound interest in the Django web framework and python programming.

* It was this interest, spotted by Professor Mihaela Sabin, the chair of the AES Department at UNH, helped Shravani get an internship position as a Web developer at UNH. She had developed a web application that automates the access and management of transfer course evaluation activities at UNH.


* As per her - "Interning within the university is very flexible in terms of scheduling my working hours, because of the pandemic but, making sure that the work is completed on time. We plan our work every week, this way the progress is effective."
