## Kevin

- Worked as a web developer at GYK Antler, a mid-sized marketing agency which provides branding, video production, web development services, and more.

- Went through the full internship process before being hired on and becoming a Full Stack Web Developer for the company

- Completed an applied research project for the company where he helped integrate a small data presentation start-up into his own company, while adapting the software for their specific needs

- Had lots of freedom over the project and had to set up meetings on his own, which was stressful but ended up teaching him a lot about self-discipline and project management
