## Mellisa

- Worked for URSA, a start-up in Manchester which creates risk management software for unmanned systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones.

- Created "Classifiers", programs which determine whether a certain behavior has occurred, such as traveling in a straight-line path.

- Worked in an iterative process, where she would have a chance to build her code on her own before reviewing and taking advice from a senior advisor

- Enjoyed working in a flexible work environment, where she could dress casually and create her own schedule with flexible hours and options to work from home
