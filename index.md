## Welcome to Internship Experience Course

Welcome to the UNH Manchester Internship Experience website. This website contains information for the COMP690, COMP890, and DATA690 Internship Experience classes. In these classes, students will be provided with field-based learning at a business, non-profit, or government organization. Students will gain practical skills relating to their major which will allow them to gain insight into their potential career path, and will help them to build professional connections in their field. Their internship will also allow them to apply knowledge and skills acquired through other coursework in the major to address and solve new, authentic problems identified by the internship employer.
